1) The problem to be solved is to create a therapist chatbot called Eliza that
2) is able to converse as humanly as possible with any user. Eliza should be able to respond to concerns, personal problems, questions, statements and respond with appropriate psychobabble that makes the user feel heard and supported, using regular expressions. Eliza should use spot specific words and use them in Eliza's response. Eliza should also take the user's statements and transform them into related questions/responses. 2) Usage: python3 eliza.py. To quit program, enter 'quit'. Example Input/Output: [eliza] Hi, I'm a psychotherapist. What is your name? My name is Esha. [eliza] Hi Esha. How can I help you today? I want to rule the world. [eliza] Why do you want to rule the world? I don't know, I think I crave power. [eliza] Why don't you tell me more about your cravings?
